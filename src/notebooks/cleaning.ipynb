       "  'travel_transportation': '<div style=\"margin-top:5px\">         <p><p><b>Traffic Safety and Road Conditions:</b>&nbsp;Road conditions in Afghanistan are generally poor. Many urban streets in Afghanistan have large potholes and are not well lit, and rural roads are frequently not paved. There have also been reports of cave-ins and erosion on the Ring Road (the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat-Mazar highway). Vehicles are often poorly maintained and overloaded. Traffic laws are often not enforced, and roadside assistance is non-existent. Vehicular traffic is chaotic, and drivers must contend with numerous pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals. With congested roads, non-standard traffic patterns, and abundant pedestrian traffic, vehicle accidents are a serious concern and can escalate into violent confrontations when involving foreigners. All drivers are urged to drive defensively, drive only in the daylight, and pay close attention to their surroundings. Owners of vehicles with tinted windows can be arrested. Please see the Department of State’s additional information on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html\">Road Safety</a>.</p><p>U.S. citizens should also be aware that land mines and large quantities of unexploded ordnance exist throughout the countryside and along roads, posing a danger to travelers. Robberies and kidnappings are also prevalent on the roads outside Kabul.</p><p>Aviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Afghanistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the FAA has issued a Notice to Airmen (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/media/KICZ_A0029-21_NOTAM-Afghanistan_KABUL_FIR.pdf\">NOTAM</a>) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

       "  'health': '<div style=\"margin-top:5px\">         <p><p>Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities vary in quality and range of services and are generally below U.S. standards. Doctors and hospitals often require cash prepayment for services. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel. Western-style private clinics can be found in Kabul offering a variety of basic emergency and routine preventative-type care, but their hours are limited, and such facilities may not be suitable for complex trauma cases or severe medical emergencies. Individuals without licenses or medical degrees operate private clinics, and there is no public agency that monitors their operations. A list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://af.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/\">Medical Clinics in Afghanistan</a>&nbsp;is available on the U.S. Embassy’s website.</p><p>Travelers are strongly urged to obtain sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications prior to arrival. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available in Afghanistan. Travelers should be alert that many pharmaceuticals found in Afghanistan are counterfeits, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven.</p><p><b>We do not pay medical bills.</b> Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Insurance:</b>&nbsp;Make sure your health insurance plan will cover you outside of the United States, and specifically covers care when you are in Afghanistan, as many insurance companies consider the country to be an active warzone and specifically exclude coverage for individuals residing or traveling here. Please also note that U.S. Medicare does not pay overseas. U.S. citizens are strongly recommended to obtain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html\">supplemental medical evacuation insurance</a>&nbsp;as medical transport out of Afghanistan can be prohibitively expensive. When selecting medical evacuation provider, be sure to confirm that the company offers such services in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as a medical evacuation point.&nbsp;<b>Please note that the U.S. Embassy cannot pay your medical bills.</b></p><p><b>Vaccinations: </b>Be up-to-date on all&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm\">vaccinations</a>&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;by&nbsp;the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p><b>Further health information:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.who.int/ith/en/index.html\">World Health Organization</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;(CDC)</li></ul></p></div>',\n",
       "  'local_laws_and_special_circumstances': '<div style=\"margin-top:5px\">         <p><p><b>Criminal Penalties: </b>U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are subject to Afghan laws. A U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution and may result in heightened attention by police and prosecutors, some of whom may seek to exploit your status as a U.S. citizen for financial or political gain. Persons violating Afghan laws, even unknowingly, may be fined, arrested, imprisoned, or possibly executed. Penalties in Afghanistan can be more severe than for similar offenses in the United States.</p><p>Photography of military installations, including equipment or troops, may lead to arrest or detention. Possession of alcohol is illegal as is driving under the influence. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, with offenders often facing long jail sentences and heavy fines. Sexual relations between unmarried couples are generally forbidden in Afghanistan.</p><p>U.S. citizens should also note that they are still subject to U.S. federal laws while traveling or living abroad. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html#ExternalPopup\">prosecutable in the United States.</a></p><p>Religion and Islam: Islam provides the foundation for Afghan customs, laws, and practices. Foreign visitors -- men and women -- are expected to remain sensitive to the Islamic culture and not dress in a revealing or provocative manner, including the wearing of sleeveless shirts and blouses, halter-tops, and shorts.</p><p>Although the Constitution of Afghanistan allows for the <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html\">free exercise of religion</a>, proselytizing may be deemed contrary to Islam and harmful to society. Committing a blasphemous act or producing or distributing material deemed critical of Islam is punishable by long-term incarceration or the death sentence. Apostasy may carry a maximum penalty of death for Muslims who denounce Islam or convert to another religion. Allegations of conversion of Afghan citizens are taken particularly seriously. False accusations of blasphemy or insulting Islam have led to deadly mob violence.</p><p>Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.

Hiring an attorney in the early stages of such a dispute is recommended. Please refer to our list t of <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html\">lawyers in Afghanistan</a></p><p><b>Women Travelers:</b> Afghanistan is a traditional country, particularly when it comes to gender roles and behavior. To help maintain a low profile, women should ensure their shirts cover their full arms, collarbone, and waistband, and their pants/skirts cover their ankles, especially when traveling outside Kabul. Almost all women in Afghanistan cover their hair in public; female travelers are advised to carry scarves for this purpose. Women visiting Afghanistan should be alert of the risk of sexual assault and are recommended to review the Department of State’s travel tips for <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html#ExternalPopup\">women travelers</a>.</p><p><b>LGBTI Rights:</b> While homosexuality is not explicitly illegal under Afghan law, individuals may be prosecuted under laws forbidding sodomy, and sexual relations between unmarried individuals is generally forbidden. LGBTI individuals face discrimination, violence, and persecution in Afghan society. See our <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html#ExternalPopup\">LGBTI Travel Information</a> page and section 6 of our <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html\">Human Rights report</a> for further details.</p><p><b>Forced Marriage: </b>The Embassy is aware of cases involving U.S. citizen women of Afghan heritage who have been convinced by their families to travel to Afghanistan, usually under the guise of visiting relatives, only to find themselves forced into marriage. The U.S. government considers forced marriage to be a violation of basic human rights and in the case of minors, a form of child abuse. Forced marriage is defined as one in which one or both parties have not consented to the marriage (or are incapable of providing meaningful consent) and differs from arranged marriage. Often, victims of forced marriage are subjected to non-consensual sex, physical and emotional abuse, and isolation. Individuals who refuse a forced marriage may be threatened with violence or with being disowned by their families, who also often confiscate their belongings (including passports).</p><p><b>Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:</b> Afghan law protects the rights of persons with disabilities, but the provisions are not implemented in practice. Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.</p><p><b>Banking:</b> Access to banking facilities in Afghanistan is limited and unreliable. The economy generally operates on a cash-only basis, though the use of credit cards is becoming more common in larger cities. ATMs are available in major cities, but U.S. banks often deny transactions from Afghanistan unless a traveler provides advanced notice of the transaction. International wire transfers options are limited.</p><p><b>Customs:</b> Afghan customs authorities generally enforce strict regulations on the import/export of certain goods such as alcoholic beverages, religious materials, antiquities, medication, precious stones and metals, and printed materials. U.S. citizen travelers have faced fines and/or confiscation of items considered antiquities upon exiting Afghanistan. Weapons/Firearms: U.S. citizens, including security contractors and military personnel, should carefully review Afghan import/export restrictions on weapons, firearms, and ammunition, including antique or display models. It is also important to review the regulations of any country through which you may transit, as many countries have strict rules prohibiting these items, even in checked luggage. Consult the <a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html#ExternalPopup\">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> for information on traveling with such items into or out of the United States.</p></p></div>',\n",

The security situation is extremely unstable and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. U.S. citizens who do decide to come to Afghanistan should maintain a low profile and exercise extreme discretion in disclosing their movement plans and personal information. Security alerts for Afghanistan can be found here.</i></p><p><b><i>Terrorism: </i></b><i>Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: </i></p><ul><li><i>High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)</i></li><li><i>Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists</i></li><li><i>Places of worship</i></li><li><i>Schools</i></li><li><i>Parks</i></li><li><i>Shopping malls and markets</i></li><li><i>Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)</i></li></ul><p><b><i>Terrorist Attacks: </i></b><i>Decades of disorder and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terrorism. U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals are primary targets of terrorist organizations. Extremist groups across Afghanistan continue to utilize a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a public perception of instability. Such tactics include the use of attackers laden with suicide vests, vehicle-borne explosive devices, magnetic explosive devices, indirect fire (rockets and mortars), and direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades). Military and security personnel, Afghan government buildings, foreign embassies, non-government organization offices, and soft targets, such as hotels, markets, schools, hospitals, and public gatherings, are common attack targets. Kabul has been and remains a high-profile location for large-scale insurgent attacks, as successful operations in the capital tend to generate media coverage. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should familiarize themselves with their residential&nbsp;compound or hotel’s emergency planning and rehearse the steps they would take if the venue were to come under attack.</i></p><p><i>For more information, see our </i><a href=\"https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Afghanistan.html#ExternalPopup\"><i>Terrorism</i></a><i> page.</i></p><p><b><i>Kidnapping/Hostage Taking: </i></b><i>Extremist groups and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals, specifically U.S. citizens, in Afghanistan, including journalists, aid workers, teachers, medical professionals, and individuals associated with international and non-governmental organizations. Criminal groups in Afghanistan will target any individual perceived to have money for kidnapping and/or extortion. Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially spending years in captivity.</i></p><p><b><i>Demonstrations and Riots: </i></b><i>U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations, as even events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Public gatherings and demonstrations have also been the targets of terrorist attacks.</i></p><p><b><i>Property/Business Disputes: </i></b><i>Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property often become involved in complicated real estate disputes involving threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business or commercial disputes have been threatened with detention, arrest, and imprisonment, and had their property seized to use as collateral. U.S. citizens have reported being physically attacked and family members have also been harmed as the result of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. Embassy will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes. Hiring a private attorney, early on the dispute, especially one who can act on behalf of the U.S. citizen when he/she is outside Afghanistan, is recommended.</i></p><p><b><i>Communications: </i></b><i>Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated and landline telephone communications remain limited. Cell phone service is unpredictable, and areas outside major urban centers suffer from irregular and weak signals. Insurgents have been known to attack telecommunications infrastructure and coerce operators into turning off cell phone towers. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should always carry backup communications such as satellite phones or handheld radios, along with a vehicle/personal tracking device.</i></p><p><b><i>Crime: </i></b><i>Afghanistan is considered a critical threat environment for crime. Criminal organizations, including weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. Common petty or street crime exists, primarily in cities. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples may contribute to crime and lawlessness.</i></p><p><b><i>Victims of Crime: There is no U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. </i></b><i>The local equivalent to the U.S. “911” emergency line is “119” in Afghanistan. Please note that local operators do not speak English and that emergency services are restricted to the major cities. The emergency line may not be answered, and response times are usually longer than in the United States.</i></p><p><i>Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime committed in Afghanistan, but travelers should not rely on significant assistance from such authorities in resolving legal disputes.

Traffic laws are often not enforced, and roadside assistance is non-existent. Vehicular traffic is chaotic, and drivers must contend with numerous pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals. With congested roads, non-standard traffic patterns, and abundant pedestrian traffic, vehicle accidents are a serious concern and can escalate into violent confrontations when involving foreigners. All drivers are urged to drive defensively, drive only in the daylight, and pay close attention to their surroundings. Owners of vehicles with tinted windows can be arrested. Please see the Department of State’s additional information on Road Safety . U.S. citizens should also be aware that land mines and large quantities of unexploded ordnance exist throughout the countryside and along roads, posing a danger to travelers. Robberies and kidnappings are also prevalent on the roads outside Kabul. Aviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Afghanistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the FAA has issued a Notice to Airmen ( NOTAM ) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices .',\n",
       "  'health': 'Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities vary in quality and range of services and are generally below U.S. standards. Doctors and hospitals often require cash prepayment for services. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel. Western-style private clinics can be found in Kabul offering a variety of basic emergency and routine preventative-type care, but their hours are limited, and such facilities may not be suitable for complex trauma cases or severe medical emergencies. Individuals without licenses or medical degrees operate private clinics, and there is no public agency that monitors their operations. A list of Medical Clinics in Afghanistan is available on the U.S. Embassy’s website. Travelers are strongly urged to obtain sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications prior to arrival. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available in Afghanistan. Travelers should be alert that many pharmaceuticals found in Afghanistan are counterfeits, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan will cover you outside of the United States, and specifically covers care when you are in Afghanistan, as many insurance companies consider the country to be an active warzone and specifically exclude coverage for individuals residing or traveling here. Please also note that U.S. Medicare does not pay overseas. U.S. citizens are strongly recommended to obtain supplemental medical evacuation insurance as medical transport out of Afghanistan can be prohibitively expensive. When selecting medical evacuation provider, be sure to confirm that the company offers such services in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as a medical evacuation point. Please note that the U.S. Embassy cannot pay your medical bills. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

       "  'local_laws_and_special_circumstances': 'Criminal Penalties: U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are subject to Afghan laws. A U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution and may result in heightened attention by police and prosecutors, some of whom may seek to exploit your status as a U.S. citizen for financial or political gain. Persons violating Afghan laws, even unknowingly, may be fined, arrested, imprisoned, or possibly executed. Penalties in Afghanistan can be more severe than for similar offenses in the United States. Photography of military installations, including equipment or troops, may lead to arrest or detention. Possession of alcohol is illegal as is driving under the influence. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, with offenders often facing long jail sentences and heavy fines. Sexual relations between unmarried couples are generally forbidden in Afghanistan. U.S. citizens should also note that they are still subject to U.S. federal laws while traveling or living abroad. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States. Religion and Islam: Islam provides the foundation for Afghan customs, laws, and practices. Foreign visitors -- men and women -- are expected to remain sensitive to the Islamic culture and not dress in a revealing or provocative manner, including the wearing of sleeveless shirts and blouses, halter-tops, and shorts. Although the Constitution of Afghanistan allows for the free exercise of religion , proselytizing may be deemed contrary to Islam and harmful to society. Committing a blasphemous act or producing or distributing material deemed critical of Islam is punishable by long-term incarceration or the death sentence. Apostasy may carry a maximum penalty of death for Muslims who denounce Islam or convert to another religion. Allegations of conversion of Afghan citizens are taken particularly seriously. False accusations of blasphemy or insulting Islam have led to deadly mob violence. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad Financial Debts : U.S. citizens in Afghanistan have been detained and arrested in cases involving financial debts and contract disputes, as these disputes are generally considered as criminal matters in Afghanistan. Hiring an attorney in the early stages of such a dispute is recommended. Please refer to our list t of lawyers in Afghanistan Women Travelers: Afghanistan is a traditional country, particularly when it comes to gender roles and behavior. To help maintain a low profile, women should ensure their shirts cover their full arms, collarbone, and waistband, and their pants/skirts cover their ankles, especially when traveling outside Kabul. Almost all women in Afghanistan cover their hair in public; female travelers are advised to carry scarves for this purpose. Women visiting Afghanistan should be alert of the risk of sexual assault and are recommended to review the Department of State’s travel tips for women travelers . LGBTI Rights: While homosexuality is not explicitly illegal under Afghan law, individuals may be prosecuted under laws forbidding sodomy, and sexual relations between unmarried individuals is generally forbidden. LGBTI individuals face discrimination, violence, and persecution in Afghan society. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Forced Marriage: The Embassy is aware of cases involving U.S. citizen women of Afghan heritage who have been convinced by their families to travel to Afghanistan, usually under the guise of visiting relatives, only to find themselves forced into marriage. The U.S. government considers forced marriage to be a violation of basic human rights and in the case of minors, a form of child abuse. Forced marriage is defined as one in which one or both parties have not consented to the marriage (or are incapable of providing meaningful consent) and differs from arranged marriage. Often, victims of forced marriage are subjected to non-consensual sex, physical and emotional abuse, and isolation. Individuals who refuse a forced marriage may be threatened with violence or with being disowned by their families, who also often confiscate their belongings (including passports). Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Afghan law protects the rights of persons with disabilities, but the provisions are not implemented in practice. Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators. Banking: Access to banking facilities in Afghanistan is limited and unreliable. The economy generally operates on a cash-only basis, though the use of credit cards is becoming more common in larger cities. ATMs are available in major cities, but U.S. banks often deny transactions from Afghanistan unless a traveler provides advanced notice of the transaction. International wire transfers options are limited. Customs: Afghan customs authorities generally enforce strict regulations on the import/export of certain goods such as alcoholic beverages, religious materials, antiquities, medication, precious stones and metals, and printed materials. U.S. citizen travelers have faced fines and/or confiscation of items considered antiquities upon exiting Afghanistan. Weapons/Firearms: U.S. citizens, including security contractors and military personnel, should carefully review Afghan import/export restrictions on weapons, firearms, and ammunition, including antique or display models. It is also important to review the regulations of any country through which you may transit, as many countries have strict rules prohibiting these items, even in checked luggage. Consult the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for information on traveling with such items into or out of the United States.',\n",
       "  'safety_and_security': 'On August 31, the U.S. Embassy suspended services. Please read the  Afghanistan Travel Advisory which advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan and those in Afghanistan should shelter in place. The security situation is extremely unstable and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. U.S. citizens who do decide to come to Afghanistan should maintain a low profile and exercise extreme discretion in disclosing their movement plans and personal information. Security alerts for Afghanistan can be found here. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist Attacks: Decades of disorder and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terrorism. U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals are primary targets of terrorist organizations. Extremist groups across Afghanistan continue to utilize a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a public perception of instability. Such tactics include the use of attackers laden with suicide vests, vehicle-borne explosive devices, magnetic explosive devices, indirect fire (rockets and mortars), and direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades). Military and security personnel, Afghan government buildings, foreign embassies, non-government organization offices, and soft targets, such as hotels, markets, schools, hospitals, and public gatherings, are common attack targets. Kabul has been and remains a high-profile location for large-scale insurgent attacks, as successful operations in the capital tend to generate media coverage. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should familiarize themselves with their residential compound or hotel’s emergency planning and rehearse the steps they would take if the venue were to come under attack. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Kidnapping/Hostage Taking: Extremist groups and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals, specifically U.S. citizens, in Afghanistan, including journalists, aid workers, teachers, medical professionals, and individuals associated with international and non-governmental organizations. Criminal groups in Afghanistan will target any individual perceived to have money for kidnapping and/or extortion. Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially spending years in captivity. Demonstrations and Riots: U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations, as even events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Public gatherings and demonstrations have also been the targets of terrorist attacks. Property/Business Disputes: Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property often become involved in complicated real estate disputes involving threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business or commercial disputes have been threatened with detention, arrest, and imprisonment, and had their property seized to use as collateral. U.S. citizens have reported being physically attacked and family members have also been harmed as the result of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. Embassy will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes. Hiring a private attorney, early on the dispute, especially one who can act on behalf of the U.S. citizen when he/she is outside Afghanistan, is recommended. Communications: Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated and landline telephone communications remain limited. Cell phone service is unpredictable, and areas outside major urban centers suffer from irregular and weak signals. Insurgents have been known to attack telecommunications infrastructure and coerce operators into turning off cell phone towers. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should always carry backup communications such as satellite phones or handheld radios, along with a vehicle/personal tracking device. Crime: Afghanistan is considered a critical threat environment for crime. Criminal organizations, including weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. Common petty or street crime exists, primarily in cities. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples may contribute to crime and lawlessness. Victims of Crime: There is no U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. The local equivalent to the U.S. “911” emergency line is “119” in Afghanistan. Please note that local operators do not speak English and that emergency services are restricted to the major cities. The emergency line may not be answered, and response times are usually longer than in the United States. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime committed in Afghanistan, but travelers should not rely on significant assistance from such authorities in resolving legal disputes. This is especially true of U.S.-based companies and their employees seeking local protection from extralegal efforts to resolve contract disputes. Property may be seized, and personnel may be detained as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes. See the Department of State’s webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas for additional details. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .',\n",

Passport and Visas: U.S. Citizens must have a valid passport and Afghan visa to enter and exit Afghanistan. Travelers arriving without a valid visa are subjected to deportation or confiscation of their passport and heavy fines. Dual Nationals/Afghan Heritage: U.S. citizens born in Afghanistan of Afghan parents are considered to be Afghan nationals and are not required to have an entry visa. For U.S. citizens of Afghan parentage, but not born in Afghanistan, an entry permit is required. Registration: Foreigners arriving in Afghanistan are fingerprinted during the immigration process. Foreign passengers arriving at the Kabul International Airport are expected to register with a representative of the Ministry of Interior’s Foreigners’ Registration Office. If the airport office is closed, registration may take place at the Ministry of Interior’s Kabul Statistics Office located at Kart-e-Parwan Square in front of Nadirya High School. The registration card must be surrendered upon the foreign national’s departure from Afghanistan.

       "  'travel_transportation': 'Driving conditions in Albanian can differ significantly from those in the United States. Reckless driving is common. Many drivers do not pay attention to traffic regulations, signals, lane markings, pedestrians, or other drivers. The number of fatalities from traffic accidents is high compared to other European countries. Road conditions vary and are especially poor in rural areas in winter months and during inclement weather. Older sections of the roadway system are poorly lit. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. All international driving permits (IDP) issued under the 1949 Geneva Convention are accepted. An international driving permit can only be used for one year. If you wish to drive in Albania for more than one year, you must apply for an Albanian license. In Albania, driving is on the right-hand side of the road . Everyone in the vehicle must wear a seat belt. Mobile phones can be used while driving, but only with a hands-free set. Third-party insurance is required. Be aware emergency response services are inadequate. First responders have limited medical training and equipment. Accident victims are often transported to the nearest hospital in the car of a passerby. Do not travel at night. Travel outside of urban areas is particularly dangerous. Fuel and repair services are common in populated areas, but there is no formal roadside assistance. Tires and replacement parts may not be available. Traffic Laws: You may be asked to show your passport in addition to a U.S. or international driver’s license if stopped. Police should provide you with a written ticket citing any fine issued. While procedures may vary by district, you should not generally pay fines directly to police officers; these will be collected at a local police precinct or court. If you have an accident, do not move your car, and wait for police to arrive. Disregard for traffic laws is widespread. You can use a U.S. or international driver’s license while in non-resident status in Albania. U.S. citizens remaining in Albania longer than one year must register and apply for resident status and must also apply for an Albanian driver’s license. It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol at any detectable level.  Albania practices a zero-tolerance policy.  The police will seize your driver’s license and vehicle if caught. You may also be fined or receive up to six months in prison. It is against the law to use a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving. You will be fined if caught. Public Transportation: Public transportation options are limited and not generally recommended for visitors. However, marked taxis are considered safe and recommended for use. There are no commercial domestic flights. Rail conditions are poor, limited, and service is unreliable. Private buses travel between most cities almost exclusively during the day on variable schedules. Intra-city transit is an unofficial system of privately-owned vans operating without schedules, set fares, or, occasionally, government permission. Many of these vans do not adhere to accepted safety and maintenance standards or driver training. Consider the condition of the van before traveling in one. See our Road Safety page for more information. Aviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Albania, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Albania’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page . Maritime Travel: Mariners planning travel to Albania should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .

Health facilities in general: Adequate health facilities are available in Tirana and other cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics lack many basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always accepted. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Medical staff may not speak English. Generally, public hospitals are minimally staff overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas In Albania, while many medicines are available without a prescription, certain pharmaceuticals may require a prescription from a physician and are sold only at specialized pharmacies. Some medications may not be available locally. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments recommended by a physician. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.

Crime: Credit card fraud is common in Albania, and you should exercise caution by not letting your card out of sight when making a transaction. Visitors need to be very careful when using ATMs. Be alert for strangers looking over your shoulders at the PIN number, and also for any interference with the machine itself that could indicate a camera or card scanner that steals your details when you scan your card. Carjacking is rare in Albania, but vehicle theft may occur. Make sure your vehicle is locked and keep your possessions well hidden in the trunk. Recent crime statistics indicate a decrease in numerous violent crime categories to include attempted murder, robberies by force and armed robberies. Street crime is common in urban areas, predominantly at night. The most notable are burglaries, theft, and domestic violence claims. Attacks using small improvised explosive devices and targeting individuals in contentious disputes have occurred. Remain vigilant when parking in unattended parking areas, avoid parking overnight in non-secure areas, and inspect vehicles for suspicious items. If you find something strange, do not tamper with it and contact the Albanian Police immediately. Law enforcement’s ability to protect and assist travelers is limited in some areas, especially in remote regions. There has been targeted violence associated with illicit drug networks and organized crime countrywide. Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings and the extent of police and emergency services in their area. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.
